otherscripts
============
This git holds various scripts that I feel make my life easier or I can't find a different git repo for. Enjoy!

testing.sh -- testing framework. Will output all information from a script during runtime to various log/txt files for easier
troubleshooting/testing purposes. Does not deal with hooks or "low" system interactions. There are tools for malware analysis
that will provide those functions.
